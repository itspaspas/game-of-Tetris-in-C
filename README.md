the assginment was about creating a tetris game using functional programming. we were not allowed to use global variables and the program shouldn't have ended when we lost. also there were 2
bonus sections: one about changing the speed of each falling tetromino and defining the number of rotations per space pressed and the other one about showing the tetromino-in-line to fall.
although the milestones were reached but one problem could not be resolved and that was the flickering image of the game. I tried ncurses/ncurses.h library but it complicated my code and 
since this was not a goal to be achieved, I ignored it.
